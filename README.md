Task 1: Strategy Development and Backtesting for APPLE DATASET

Subtasks:
1. Strategy Development:
Task:
Developed three different trading strategies or alphas.
Ensured that each strategy has clear entry and exit rules, position sizing, and risk management parameters.
2. Backtesting:
Task:
Backtest each strategy using the provided APPLE dataset. Incorporated realistic assumptions such as transaction costs, slippage, and execution delays.
Evaluate the performance of each strategy using key metrics such as:
1) Sharpe Ratio
2) Sortino Ratio
3) Max Drawdown
4) Annualized Return
5) Cumulative Return
Analyze how each strategy contributes to the overall portfolio performance.
3. Portfolio Analysis:
Task:
Combined the three strategies into a single portfolio. Assessed the portfolio's overall performance, including diversification benefits, correlation between strategies, and risk-adjusted returns.
Included a summary of trade logs, showing individual trades, entry/exit points, and trade-level performance.

TASK-2 : Implemented LSTM model on NIFTY50 dataset and predicting the close prices.
Normalization and Standardization:
Task:
Normalized and standardized the features to ensure they are on the same scale and improve model performance. This step is critical for training machine learning model.
3. Machine Learning Model Development and Backtesting:
Task:
Trained a LSTM model on the engineered features to predict future price movements or generate trading signals.
